    <p>
        I am a software engineering major, and am interested in also doing graphic design. This is my second semester here at BYU Idaho. I'm from Monument, Colorado, although my family lives in Utah now. I love music, listening to music and playing instruments. I play clarinet, saxophone, and piano.
